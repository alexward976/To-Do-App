# Overview

This To-Do List web app is exactly that, a to do list. Users can enter in their various tasks, and they will be added to the list. The tasks can then be marked complete (indicated by a strikethrough) or deleted. The list can also be sorted, resulting in incompleted tasks at the top and completed ones at the bottom.

In creating this simple to-do list, my goal was to stretch myself in my JavaScript knowledge. I gave myself certain requirements, like using a JS library I didn't know. To accomplish this, I used Anime.JS, a tool to do animations in JavaScript.

# Development Environment

This web app was developed in Visual Studio Code using the Live Server extension. 

JavaScript was the primary language used, and the Anime.JS library was imported to create simple animations.

- Store the to-do list in session storage, that way it isn't deleted every time the page is reloaded.
- Sort by date option
